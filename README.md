   ### In development:

   ```

   ### In Production: 

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
## Routes

   Routers are automatically loaded based on their name and class name by routers/routes.js file, it loops all the files in the folder routes and loads them for you so that you don't have to manually import them.

   i.e.

   authRouter.js >
   ```js
      export default class AuthRouter extends BaseRouter{
         static urlPath = "/auth";
         constructor(router) {
            super(router, AuthController);
            this.router.get('/login', AuthController.generateLoginPage);
            this.router.get('/logout', AuthController.logOutUser);
            this.router.post("/submit_login", AuthController.attemptLogin);
         }
      };
   ```

   file name and class name should be the same with naming convention in mind.

   The variable urlPath defines the prefix of the URL per router
   Syntax: 
      http://localhost:7896/:urlPath/url
   i.ie
   ```js
      static urlPath = "/auth";
   ```

      http://localhost:7896/auth/
      
## Controllers

   Controllers are simple having static functions in the class, can be exported and called, take an example of working of AuthController with AuthRouter 

   ### example:
   ```js
   export class MyController extends BaseController {

      constructor() {
         super();
      }

      static async someRandomController(req, res) {
         
      }
   }
   ```
## Views
   Views are placed inside pages folder, having layout and partials.
   
   Layouts are the structure in the page (component is loaded) along with partials ( repeated parts of the code. )
   The variables are populated using handlebars. you can also use ejs instead of handlebars.
   The pages are generated using utils/generator.js file. 

   Layout:
   ```sh
   .
   ├── layouts
   │   ├── authcontext.hbs
   │   ├── basic.hbs
   │   └── dashboardcontext.hbs
   ├── pages
   │   ├── http
   │   │   └── error.hbs
   │   ├── index.hbs
   │   └── login.hbs
   └── partials
      ├── footer.hbs
      ├── navbar.hbs
      ├── scripts.hbs
      └── sidebar.hbs
   ```
